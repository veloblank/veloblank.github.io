This is one of my many attempts at starting up a blog while going through Flatiron School. Many of my attempts fell flat because I didn't understand how a website worked very well. I knew that if I clicked a link it would take me to another page, but I didn't understand the relationship of the pages, their markup and other assets. I overly complicated things.

Then, as I was going through HTML and CSS, I decided to go ultra simple and explore Jekyll. I downloaded several templates, but got frustrated with the templating language and just the overall styles not suiting my needs.

Fast forward many months later, and here the site is in it's current form. I decided to stick with a Jekyll theme, rather than do a bunch of building out of my own. After working with lodash and Handlebars, I see through to the markup "magic" and how simple it actually is to implement in a blog site, and why a developer would choose to use DRY templating.
