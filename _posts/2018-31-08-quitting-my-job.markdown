So this is officially "it". It's the end and it's the beginning. This coming week is my last official week at my warehousing job. I'm approaching the 80% completion mark of Flatiron School and my meeting with my education counselor a few weeks spurred me to make the decision to make the final sprint stretch sans an IRL job.

It's a scary thing. I've always made the comparison that it's like swinging through the jungle without another vine in your hand. This is a blind letting go of the vine that's in my hand and just falling towards the next blurry vine I see ahead of me. How I get there is up to me. If I get there is up to me. All that I know is it had to be done.

Yes, having a job is an important thing. It's been pretty much the most important thing in my life. But the grind of this current job has just been wearing on me and it has affected my time spent working on my school modules and projects. It has kept me from lectures, interacting with the Flatiron community, attending Meet-ups and just socializing with the web dev community in general. I had a hard time declining the overtime. Eventually, the overtime became a nightly thing, and a normal 40 hour work week ballooned into 50+ each week. Couple that with car-pooling/commuting and I was spending 14 hours each day at or near my job. When I came home I was always so tired. I barely had enough energy for a shower and breakfast. There has also been constant construction behind my apartment. This led to massive sleep-debt and just an overall unhealthy attitude towards the rest of the non-3rd-shift world.

As far as school is concerned, quitting my job makes the most sense. The web development program was intended to be a full-time program. Giving it only a few hours each week will drag it out a long, long time, and it's such a big step up for me once I complete it that a little bit of a sacrifice now will lead to much better things down the road--many of them still to come this year. There's still time left in 2018!

I'm currently working on a few side projects. I really need to keep working on projects to practice my programming and to start to wrangle back the passion I had at the start and middle of the curriculum. In the middle of 2017 my spirit for finding and accomplishing new and exciting things for myself was killed off and I allowed myself to just wallow for entirely too long in self-pity and anger. It affected everything that I had going for me at the time. I refuse to ever revisit that time of my life again.

Like many other times, the Geographic Cure is best for me. Graduating from Flatiron will allow me to find awesome jobs in cities and countries that fit in with my raison d'Ãªtre. That's been lacking in my life for a long time--possibly my whole life. Nothing will ever be as important to me than that eventual shift in my near future. I need to stay focused on that objective and that mindset because it is all too easy to fall back into complacency. I am actually jealous of those people who have the determination to reach for the stars and who overcome extreme odds against them to pursue education or career goals. Those are the real MVPs in life.

My projects consistently focus on other hobbies or interests I have. I agree with many tech writers that this is probably the single most important thing for a developer--**start developing things you are interested in.** If you're not interested in a To-Do app tutorial, don't do it. While ignoring it entirely might not expose you to common design patterns, it will kill your desire to be a programmer because it isn't interesting or fun. To me, programming should be fun. At least, I want it to be fun for me. That means my projects will look like poker applications, games, interactive websites, applications related to gambling or math or artificial intelligence. It means creating applications that will help the user achieve something; from purchasing something, to making a donation to a cause, to wasting some time with a game.

Starting projects is one thing, however. Actually building them out satisfactorily and/or finishing them is another. I need to realize that at this point in my education it's important that I do build the applications out in a way that demonstrates my understanding of a library or language, at least enough for a prospective employer to take a chance on me to take on _their_ project. Whether or not I finish a roulette application after being hired will take on less importance, but it will keep my interest in programming, even after receiving my first paycheck.

For now, I'd like to work on setting some goals for September. I love how measurable a student's progress is on Learn. It's also very visual. That will help direct my goals in the coming weeks as I phase out from being a lifelong grinder to a new career as a web developer.
