I decided to warm-up yesterday by not actually doing any programming on my OO-CLI project. Instead, I opened up Atom and made a very involved mockup of my CLI screen, complete with mock data output, menus, fake input, fake output--the works. When I felt like it had been stubbed out enough, I put on my Ruby Programmer hat, said my Matz prayers, and put my fingers to the keyboard. And then I sat. And sat. And sat some more. Then I got up, walked around my chair, and sat again. I did this a few more times. I imagine it looked a lot like those funny black-and-white, 2x speed CCTV footages of people doing mundane things while bored. 0 productivity. I couldn't believe it. Why did this happen?

Because of how linear creating the mockup was--from literally typing in the asterisks and the text that I envisioned my program spitting out--I think I had a hard time shifting into object-oriented thinking mode. I had trapped my brain into starting from "Line 1" and put a lot of stock into what I was going to put in "Line 1" and, "In which files would I be working from Line 1?" I was thinking top-down level code thoughts. Literally top-down. From 'Line 1' in my editor. Because I didn't know what to type on Line 1 in my CLI file, my scraper file and in my other class files, I just froze. I knew I had objects to create, and I needed object creators, but which one goes where and was I starting with the right one?

Finally I just started to type what I know. "Imagine fido equals dog dot new." "ABC. Always be coding." And the code flowed.
