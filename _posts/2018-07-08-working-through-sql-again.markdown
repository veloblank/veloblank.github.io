I'm going through the SQL section again as a refresher. I've been playing around creating fake databases with 3 to 4 fields and 3 to 4 entries and ninja-ing with the Flatiron SQL curriculum in addition to the additional materials websites. SQL seems like a skill to be an expert at, but I know that Sinatra and Rails takes a lot of the manual labor away and instead has that "it just works" Rails magic for SQL. But for the right job description that requires an SQL Ninja, it definitely is a feather to put in my cap.

So far I have experience with only relational databases. My brain finds this easier after having worked with Excel on a lot of little hobby, side projects, creating tables and entries with easily labeled columns and data. I don't see myself trying to learn noSQL unless, again, it's for a specific job description.

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) has a great full [SQL course on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=1389s). It's a pretty robust, 4 hour video, but it covers everything SQL-related, and will give a pretty good idea of what SQL is, what it does, and whether it's worth pursuing further outside of the Flatiron curriculum.
