It's quite clear programmers constantly deal with bugs. You can see them creep up in the school's [Flatcasts](https://flatcasts.herokuapp.com/#/). They show up uninvited to lectures and Study Groups. Bugs are everywhere in code. It's the *how* part of dealing with them that separates the master from his student.

I've been finishing up my CLI Gem and I was made painfully aware of the *how* part of dealing with bugs. From initially getting almost nothing to work, to tapping in the last few lines of the project bug-free (and even intercepting what would have been an "unitialized" naming-related error) it feels pretty damn good to win some small victories. 

Fascinatingly enough, the bugs keep me coming back for more. A blade doesn't become sharp by refusing to be put into a sharpener or onto a grindstone. It becomes sharp by chipping away bad steel--honed to a fine edge. This takes practice. No knife sharpener is an immediate expert. I'm sure there have been some comical times in a knife shop. Blades go flying. Swords are ruined. Hands and digits are sliced. But it's the "never quit" attitude that will get you to becoming a great programmer. It might take 20 hour coding days (like Avi). And it might mean you lose a few fingers here and there--well, not really. But through deliberate practice, you can get there.

I read an old article by Josh Waitzkin where he addresses the ["Multitasking Virus"](http://www.uschess.org/content/view/8478/463/) of our learning communities. If you have time, I suggest reading the article. In it he reminds us of a few keys to the art of learning:

1. Do what you love.
2. Do it in a way you love and connect to.
3. Release a fear of failure.
4. Build positive routines and **do one thing at a time.**

Until next time: keep your fingers away from knives and on your keyboard. Always be coding!
